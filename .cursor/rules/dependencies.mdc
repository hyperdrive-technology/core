# Dependency Management Rules

## No Downgrading Dependencies

- Do not allow downgrading of dependencies
- Always maintain or upgrade dependency versions
- Avoid breaking changes by testing upgrades first

## Version Requirements

- Node.js >= 23.6.0
- Go >= 1.24.0
- pnpm >= 10.4.0

## Dependency Management

- Use SemVer for versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Lock package versions in package.json and go.mod
- Document major dependency changes
