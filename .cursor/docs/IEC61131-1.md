# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Subject of the Book

The rapid advances in performance and miniaturization in microtechnology are constantly opening up new markets for the programmable logic controller (PLC). Specially designed controller hardware or PC-based controllers, extended by hardware and software with real-time capability, now control highly complex automation processes. This has been extended by the new subject of "safety-related controllers," aimed at preventing injury by machines during the production process.

The different types of PLCs cover a wide task spectrum - ranging from small network node computers and distributed compact units right up to modular, fault-tolerant, high-performance PLCs. They differ in performance characteristics such as processing speed, networking ability, or the selection of I/O modules they support.

Throughout this book, the term PLC is used to refer to the technology as a whole, both hardware and software, and not merely to the hardware architecture. The IEC 61131 programming languages can be used for programming classical PLCs, embedded controllers, industrial PCs, and even standard PCs, if suitable hardware (e.g., fieldbus board) for connecting sensors and actuators is available.

The broad spectrum of capability of the hardware requires corresponding support from suitable programming tools to allow low-cost, quality-conscious creation of both simple and complex software solutions. Desirable features of programming tools include:

- Simultaneous use of several PLC programming languages
- "Online" modification of programs in the PLC
- Reverse documentation of the programs from the PLC
- Reusability of PLC program blocks
- "Offline" testing and simulation of user programs
- Integrated configuring and commissioning tools
- Quality assurance, project documentation
- Use of systems with open interfaces.

Modern PCs have enabled increasingly efficient PLC programming tools to be developed in the last 10 years.

### 1.1.1 Aim of the Book

This book aims to give the reader an understandable introduction to the concepts and languages of standard IEC 61131. Simple examples are given to explain the ideas and application of the new PLC programming languages. An extensive example program summarizes the results of each section.

This book serves as a helpful guide and introduction for people in training and at work who want to become acquainted with the possibilities of the new standard. It describes the methods of the standard from a manufacturer-independent perspective.

Some experience with personal computers and basic knowledge in the field of PLC technology are required. Experienced PLC programmers will also find information here to ease working with these programming systems.

### 1.1.2 Structure of the Book

This book is intended to answer the following questions:

- How do you program in accordance with IEC 61131? What are the essential ideas of the standard and how can they be applied in practice?
- What are the advantages of the new international standard IEC 61131 compared with other microcontroller or PC programming standards?
- What features must contemporary programming systems have to be consistent with IEC 61131?
- What do users need to look for when selecting a PLC programming system?

## 1.2 The IEC 61131 Standard

In several parts, standard IEC 61131 summarizes the requirements of PLC systems, including both hardware and programming systems.

IEC 61131-3 serves as a guideline for PLC programming rather than a rigid set of rules. Programming systems can only be expected to implement part of the standard. Manufacturers must document compliance with 62 feature tables.

### 1.2.1 Goals and Benefits of the Standard

Due to the increasing complexity of PLC systems, costs are rising for:

- Training of applications programmers
- The creation of increasingly larger programs
- The implementation of more complex programming systems

Standardization reduces costs through synergy and reusability.

**For Manufacturers:**
- Shared investment in multi-million dollar software
- Reduced development costs
- Increased software reliability

**For Users:**
- Reduced training time
- Simplified selection of programming systems
- Easier porting of programs across different systems

### 1.2.2 History and Components

IEC 61131 is a combination and continuation of various previous standards:

- **1977**: DIN 40 719-6 (Function Block Diagrams)
- **1979**: Start of IEC 61131 working group
- **1982**: VDI guideline 2880, sheet 4
- **1983**: DIN 19239 PLC programming
- **1985**: First IEC 61131 draft results

IEC 61131 consists of multiple parts, including:

- **IEC 61131-1**: General information
- **IEC 61131-2**: Equipment requirements and tests
- **IEC 61131-3**: Programming languages
- **IEC 61131-4**: User guidelines
- **IEC 61131-5**: Communications
- **IEC 61131-6**: Safety-related PLC
- **IEC 61131-7**: Fuzzy control programming
- **IEC 61131-8**: Guidelines for applying IEC 61131-3

## 1.3 The Organisation PLCopen

PLCopen is a manufacturer-independent and product-independent international organization. Many PLC manufacturers, software houses, and independent institutions in Europe and overseas are members.

### 1.3.1 Aims of PLCopen

Founded in 1992 after IEC 61131-3 was published, PLCopen focuses on:

- Standardized libraries for different applications
- Conformity level certification for programming languages
- Interoperability standards for software tools

### 1.3.2 Committees and Fields of Activity

PLCopen is divided into several committees, each handling a specific field:

- **Technical Committees (TCs)**
  - TC 1: Standards
  - TC 2: Function and Function Blocks
  - TC 3: Certification
  - TC 4: Communication
  - TC 5: Safe Software
  - TC 6: XML (data exchange formats)

- **Promotional Committees (PCs)**
  - PC 1: General Promotion
  - PC 2: Training
  - PC 3: North America
  - PC 4: Japan
  - PC 5: China

### 1.3.3 Results

PLCopen has achieved:

- Certification for manufacturers of PLC programming systems
- Standardized function block libraries
- Promotion of IEC 61131-3 worldwide

## Conclusion

IEC 61131-3 has established itself as the global standard for PLC programming. Through organizations like PLCopen, it continues to evolve to meet modern automation challenges.
