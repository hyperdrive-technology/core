# Chapter 3: Variables, Data Types and Common Elements

## 3.1 Simple Language Elements

This chapter explores the fundamental building blocks of the IEC 61131-3 programming languages, including variables, data types, and other common elements.

### 3.1.1 Reserved Keywords

Reserved keywords are predefined identifiers that cannot be used for variable names or function names. These include:

- `VAR`, `END_VAR`
- `PROGRAM`, `FUNCTION_BLOCK`, `FUNCTION`
- `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `END_IF`
- `FOR`, `WHILE`, `DO`, `END_FOR`, `END_WHILE`

## 3.2 Literals and Identifiers

### 3.2.1 Literals

Literals are fixed values directly written into the code. They include:

- **Boolean**: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
- **Integer**: `123`, `-45`
- **Floating Point**: `3.1415`, `-0.005`
- **String**: `'Hello'`
- **Time**: `T#5s`, `T#1h30m`

### 3.2.2 Identifiers

Identifiers are user-defined names for variables, functions, and function blocks. They must:

- Start with a letter (A-Z, a-z)
- Follow with letters, digits, or underscores
- Not be a reserved keyword

### 3.2.3 Comments

Comments in IEC 61131-3 are written as:

- Single-line: `(* This is a comment *)`
- Multi-line: `(*
   This is a multi-line comment
*)`

### 3.2.4 Pragmas

Pragmas are compiler directives used for specific configurations. Example:

```
{WARNING 'This is a compiler warning'}
```

## 3.3 Meanings of Data Types and Variables

### 3.3.1 From Direct PLC Addresses to Variables

In older PLCs, memory locations were addressed directly. IEC 61131-3 introduces named variables instead of hardcoded addresses, making programs easier to maintain.

### 3.3.2 The Data Type Determines the Properties of Variables

Each variable in IEC 61131-3 has a predefined type, which determines its:

- Memory usage
- Allowed operations
- Interpretation of stored values

### 3.3.3 Type-Specific Use of Variables

For example, a `BOOL` variable can be used in logical operations, whereas an `INT` variable can be used in arithmetic expressions.

### 3.3.4 Automatic Mapping of Variables onto the PLC

Some PLC systems allow automatic variable-to-memory mapping, reducing manual memory management.

## 3.4 Data Types

### 3.4.1 Elementary Data Types

IEC 61131-3 provides the following elementary data types:

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `BOOL`    | Boolean (TRUE/FALSE) |
| `BYTE`    | 8-bit unsigned integer |
| `INT`     | 16-bit signed integer |
| `REAL`    | Floating-point number |
| `STRING`  | Text string |
| `TIME`    | Duration value |

### 3.4.2 Derived Data Types

Users can define new data types based on existing ones. Examples include:

#### Arrays

```plaintext
ARRAY [1..10] OF INT;
```

#### Structures

```plaintext
TYPE MotorData : STRUCT
    Speed : INT;
    Temperature : REAL;
END_STRUCT
END_TYPE
```

#### Initial Values in Type Definitions

Variables can be assigned initial values upon declaration:

```plaintext
VAR
   Speed : INT := 100;
END_VAR
```

### 3.4.3 Generic Data Types

Generic data types allow functions to accept multiple compatible types. Example:

```plaintext
FUNCTION ADD_NUMBERS : REAL
VAR_INPUT
   Num1, Num2 : REAL;
END_VAR
ADD_NUMBERS := Num1 + Num2;
END_FUNCTION
```

## 3.5 Variables

### 3.5.1 Inputs, Outputs, and Flags as Special Variables

- **Inputs**: Represent external sensor data
- **Outputs**: Represent actuator control signals
- **Flags**: Temporary storage locations

### 3.5.2 Multi-Element Variables: Arrays and Structures

Multi-element variables store multiple values in a single entity:

```plaintext
ARRAY [0..9] OF INT;
```

### 3.5.3 Assignment of Initial Values at the Start of a Program

A variable's initial value can be set at startup:

```plaintext
VAR
   StartTime : TIME := T#5s;
END_VAR
```

### 3.5.4 Attributes of Variable Types

Attributes modify variable behavior:

```plaintext
VAR RETAIN Speed : INT; (* Retains value after power loss *)
```

## Conclusion

This chapter introduced variables, data types, and language elements in IEC 61131-3, setting the foundation for structured PLC programming.
