# 4. The Programming Languages of IEC 61131-3

IEC 61131-3 provides three textual languages and three graphical languages for writing application programs. The textual languages are:

- Instruction list IL,
- Structured Text ST,
- Sequential Function Chart (textual version).

The graphical languages are:

- Ladder Diagram LD,
- Function Block Diagram FBD,
- Sequential Function Chart SFC (graphical version).

The code part of the textual language ST consists of a sequence of statements and the code part of the textual language IL of a sequence of instructions.

Statements in ST, a high-level language, consist of a combination of ST keywords which control the program execution and so-called expressions. Expressions, consisting of operators/functions and operands, are evaluated at run time.

In IL, an instruction consists of an operator or a function plus a number of operands (parameters). An operator usually has one (or no) operand and a function may have one or more (or no) parameters.

The graphical languages use graphic elements to formulate the desired behaviour of the PLC. Connecting lines or so-called connectors indicate the data flow between functions and function blocks.

In the following sections, the fundamental structure of the language or graphics constructs of each language are discussed; then the individual constructs are described in detail. Finally, an example is presented for every language.

## 4.1 Instruction List IL

Instruction List IL is a convenient assembler-like programming language. IL is universally usable and is often employed as a common intermediate language to which the other textual and graphical languages are translated.

### 4.1.1 Instruction in IL

IL is a line-oriented language. An instruction, which is an executable command for the PLC, is described in exactly one line. Empty instructions in the form of blank lines are also allowed.

A statement in IL consists of the elements represented in Figure 4.1.

**Label : Operator/Function Operand (list)**

```
None, one or several constants or
variables for the operator or
input parameters for a function,
separated by commas
```

```
IL operator or function name
```

```
Colon as delimiter
Jump label in order to reach this instruction; label and
colon are optional
```

**Figure 4.1.** Instruction in IL; at least one blank space is required between operator and operand to distinguish these parts. **Comments** with (* ... *) brackets are allowed wherever a blank space may be inserted.

```
MRun: LD %IX3.0 (* Load bit from I/O *)
AND (* Mask with variable: Release *) Timer_1
ST PRun (* Store value of Run Process *)
(* Empty instruction *)
CALC Process (* Call conditionally FB Process, if PRun = TRUE *)
JMPCN MRun (* Jump, if PRun = FALSE *)
```

**Example 4.1.** Various IL instructions

The label and the comment of an IL line are optional. As of Edition 2 [IEC 61131-3], comments are allowed not only at the end of a line, but wherever a blank space may be inserted, as in the other languages. For ease of reading, however, the former convention of inserting comments only at the end of a line is continued to be applied in this book.

Labels are necessary to enable jumps in program execution to be performed from lines elsewhere in the program. A label on an otherwise empty line is allowed; the subsequent lines will be executed.

The individual operators/functions describe the desired operation; see Sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4. The operands and input parameters are explained in Chapter 3 and Appendices A and B.

Comments are identical in all languages and are delimited by a pair of asterisks and brackets (* *). This construct is used for informal comments on the contents of a line.

There is no defined format (such as column number) for the operators or operands; both parts can be separated by any number of blank spaces or tabs (see Example 4.1). The first character of an operator can start in any column.

Note: The semicolon ";" is not allowed in IL, either as a "start of comment" character (as used in many assemblers) or as a statement terminator (as used in Structured Text).

### 4.1.2 The universal accumulator (Current Result)

Standard assemblers are usually based on a real (hardware) accumulator of a processor, i.e. a value is loaded into the accumulator, further values are added, subtracted, ... and the result of the accumulator may finally be stored in a memory location.

IL is based on a similar concept, but the accumulator is a virtual one, called the Current Result (CR). The CR is a temporary variable which is used to store intermediate results. The CR is not a real register of the PLC, but a virtual register which is implemented by the programming system.

The CR is used to store the result of an operation. The next operation uses the CR as its first operand. The CR is loaded with a value using the LD operator. The content of the CR can be stored in a variable using the ST operator.

```
LD 5 (* CR := 5 *)
ADD 7 (* CR := CR + 7 = 12 *)
MUL 2 (* CR := CR * 2 = 24 *)
ST Result (* Result := CR = 24 *)
```

**Example 4.2.** The Current Result (CR) is used to store intermediate results

The CR is a typed variable, i.e. it has a data type. The data type of the CR is determined by the data type of the operand of the LD operator. The data type of the CR can change during the execution of an IL program, depending on the operations performed.

```
LD 5 (* CR := 5, CR is of type INT *)
ADD 7.0 (* CR := CR + 7.0 = 12.0, CR is of type REAL *)
ST Result (* Result := CR = 12.0, Result must be of type REAL *)
```

**Example 4.3.** The data type of the CR can change during the execution of an IL program

### 4.1.3 Operators

The operators of IL are divided into groups according to their functionality. The following table gives an overview of the operators and their modifiers.

| Group | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| C | Load and store operations | LD, ST |
| P | Parenthesis operations | (, ) |
| U | Conditional operations | JMPC, CALC |

**Table 4.1.** Groups of operators in IL

**Negation of the operand**

Some operators can be used with a negated operand. In this case, the operator is followed by the letter N. For example, the operator LD loads the value of an operand into the CR, while the operator LDN loads the negated value of the operand into the CR.

```
LD A (* CR := A *)
LDN A (* CR := NOT A *)
```

**Example 4.4.** Negation of the operand

**Nesting levels by parenthesis**

The parenthesis modifier ( is used to defer the execution of an operation. The operation is executed when the closing parenthesis ) is encountered. This allows the nesting of operations.

The Standard allows 2 ways of writing parenthesis operators; see Table 4.2

**a) Short form of parenthesis operator b) Long form of parenthesis operator**

```
LD 1
ADD( 2
...
)
```

```
LD 1
ADD(
LD 2
)
...
```

**Table 4.2.** Short form (a) and long form (b) of parenthesis operators

Note: It is not only the value of the CR which can be deferred using the parenthesis modifier, the data type can also be deferred so long as data type consistency is maintained throughout the entire instruction sequence.

**Conditional execution of operators**

Several operators, like GT, generate a Boolean value stored in the Current Result. If the Boolean value is TRUE, the following (conditional) instruction (like a conditional jump) is executed. Otherwise, the instruction following the conditional instruction is given the control of the processor:

```
LD FirstOperand
GT 20 (* Generate CR = TRUE if CR > 20, else FALSE *)
JMPC B2 (* Jump to B2, if CR = TRUE, else next line *)
JMP FarAway (* Jump to FarAway, independent of the CR *)
```

**Example 4.7.** Conditional and Unconditional form of the jump JMP/JMPC

The next three tables give a complete overview of operators and modifiers.

Some operators are reserved for Boolean data types and/or Bit String (ANY_BIT), some for generic data types, others for jumps and calls. The type compatibility of any standard function of the same name (such as ADD, ...) in IEC 61131-3 (see Appendix A) must be ensured.

IEC 61131-3 demands Boolean operands or Bit String (ANY_BIT) for the operators of Table 4.3.

### BOOL & Bit String:

| Operators | Group of operators | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| LD LDN | C | Load operand (negated) to CR |
| AND ANDN AND ( ANDN ( | P | Boolean AND of the (negated) operand with the CR |
| OR ORN OR ( ORN ( | P | Boolean OR of the (negated) operand with the CR |
| XOR XORN XOR ( XORN ( | P | Boolean Exclusive-OR of the (negated) operand with the CR |
| NOT | P | Bit-wise Boolean negation (unit complement) |
| ST STN | U | Store CR to the operand |
| S | U | Set operand TRUE, if CR=1 |
| R | U | Set operand FALSE if CR=1 |
| ) | P | Closing parenthesis; evaluate deferred operation |

**Table 4.3.** Operators with Boolean and Bit String operands (Type ANY_BIT)

Why do we need the definition of the "parenthesis" modifier? IEC 61131-3 defines standard functions like AND that allow data type ANY_BIT und thus adequately extend the operator functionality. However, in IL, it is not possible to include a computation result in a function as an operand as is allowed in ST or FBD. Therefore the parenthesis modifier was defined to make such computations possible.

```
LD V0
AND V1 OR V2 (* Error *)
ST V3
(* Attention: result not *)
(* identical to *)
(* LD V0 *)
(* AND V1 *)
(* OR V2 *)
(* ST V3 *)
```

```
LD V0
AND( V1
OR V2
)
ST V3
```

```
V3 := V0 AND
(V1 OR V2);
```

```
V1
V2
>=1
&
V0
V3
```

a) Call by std. function/operator  b) Operator  c) ST  d) FBD

**Example 4.8.** This shows how complex expressions of logical operators/std. functions are handled as a sequence of instructions using the parenthesis modifier.

The operators S and R are abbreviations for conditional storing. The operator S stands for "Store Conditional STC", R is the notation for "Store Conditional Not STCN".

| Operators | Group of operators | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| LD | C | Load operand to CR |
| ST | U | Store CR to operand |
| ADD ADD ( | P | Add operand to CR |
| SUB SUB ( | P | Subtract operand from CR |
| MUL MUL ( | P | Multiply operand with CR |
| DIV DIV ( | P | Divide CR by operand |
| MOD MOD( | P | Modulo division |
| GT GT ( | P | CR > operand (greater than) |
| GE GE ( | P | CR >= operand (greater than or equal) |
| EQ EQ ( | P | CR = operand (is equal) |
| NE NE ( | P | CR <> operand (is not equal) |
| LE LE ( | P | CR <= operand (less than or equal) |
| LT LT ( | P | CR < operand (less than) |
| ) | P | Closing parenthesis level |

**Table 4.4.** Operators for operands of generic numeric data type (type ANY_NUM)

Table 4.4 also includes the operators LD and ST. Both can be used not only for Boolean data types but also for all data types. The property that these operators support data of type ANY is similar to the functionality of "overloading of functions". The data type of the variable/constant operand defines the operator data type. It is the compiler's responsibility to activate the correct operator for the given data type.

Operators comparing two values (CR and operand) generate TRUE in the CR when the condition is TRUE, otherwise FALSE.

### Jump or Call:

| Operators | Group of operators | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| JMP JMPC JMPCN | - or U U | (Un)conditional jump to a jump label |
| CAL CALC CALCN | - U | (Un)conditional call of a function block |
| RET RETC RETCN | - or U U | (Un)conditional return from a function or function block |
| Function name | P | Function call |

**Table 4.5.** Operators for Jump and Call

### 4.1.4 Using functions and function blocks

**Calling a function**

A function is called by writing the function name followed by the input parameters. The function name is an operator in IL. The result of the function is stored in the CR.

```
LD 5
SIN (* CR := SIN(5) *)
ST Result (* Result := CR *)
```

**Example 4.9.** Calling a function in IL

**Calling a function block**

A function block is called using the CAL operator. The input parameters are assigned using the parameter assignment operator :=.

```
CAL Timer1 (IN := Start, PT := T#5s)
LD Timer1.Q
ST Result
```

**Example 4.10.** Calling a function block in IL
