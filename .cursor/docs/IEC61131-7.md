# Chapter 7: Innovative PLC Programming Tools

## 7.1 Requirements of Innovative Programming Tools

The performance of a PLC programming system can be evaluated based on three key criteria:

- Technological innovation
- Fulfillment of PLC-specific requirements
- Cost/benefit ratio

IEC 61131-3 has blurred the lines between PLCs, process computers, and PCs, impacting programming significantly. A programming system, with the help of backend compilers, can generate user code for various hardware configurations. These include:

- Compact PLC: Typically small, DIN rail-mounted devices with integrated I/O connections and proprietary operating systems.
- Modular PLC: Usually 19" PCBs communicating via I/O cartridges in the backplane, running proprietary operating systems.
- Embedded Controllers: Front-end computers with network connections like Profibus or CAN, often running proprietary OS.
- Embedded PCs: PCs with real-time Linux or Windows CE as the operating system.
- Standard PCs: PCs extended with I/O boards and realtime extensions, equipped with uninterruptible power supplies.

One programming system can handle all these combinations, and it typically runs on Windows XP or Vista, connecting to the target PLC via serial connections or LAN.

Key components of modular PLC programming systems include:

- Language Editors
- Compilers and Linkers
- System Configurators
- Device Managers
- Project Managers
- Test & Commissioning tools
- Documentation and Communication Managers

Additional tools (not part of IEC 61131-3) might include:

- Tools for plant project planning
- Simulation tools
- General data management systems
- Parameterization editors
- Logic analyzers
- SCADA systems, BDE systems, and CAD connections
- Network administration tools

## 7.2 Decompilation (Reverse Documentation)

Decompilation is a critical process in PLC programming, allowing users to retrieve and modify programs directly from the PLC without having the original source code. This is particularly important for on-site modifications where remote access to the original code is not available.

### 7.2.1 No Decompilation

Many programming systems based on IEC 61131-3 do not support decompilation. This limitation arises because the memory of PLCs cannot hold the symbolic names required for decompilation, especially as more complex programs are developed. In such systems, the only way to modify programs after deployment is by keeping project files on a hard disk for later access, ensuring the program on the controller matches the one saved on the disk.

### 7.2.2 Decompilation with Symbols and Comments

Some PLC systems provide better decompilation features, offering symbolic variable names and comments within the program. These systems store extra information such as symbolic variables, mappings of programs to tasks, and other metadata to support the decompilation process. This makes it possible to edit and understand the program more easily when retrieved from the PLC.

### 7.2.3 Decompilation Including Graphics

Advanced systems go even further, allowing decompiled programs to include graphical representations of the code. For example, graphical languages such as Ladder Diagram (LD) or Function Block Diagram (FBD) can be displayed from the PLC code, helping engineers to visualize the program's logic in a more intuitive manner.

### 7.2.4 Sources Stored in the PLC

In more sophisticated setups, PLCs can store the entire project, including source code, within a separate memory unit. This makes it possible to retrieve the project in its entirety, edit it on a PC, and upload it back to the PLC as needed.

## 7.3 Language Compatibility

Language compatibility within IEC 61131-3 allows programs to be written in different languages (such as Ladder Diagram, Function Block Diagram, and Structured Text), with various languages invoking each other. This flexibility is crucial for distributed systems where different languages may be better suited to particular tasks.

### 7.3.1 Cross-compilation

Cross-compilation refers to the ability to convert code from one language to another, such as converting an Instruction List (IL) code to Ladder Diagram (LD). The main challenge here lies in the fundamental differences between graphical and textual programming approaches. For instance, graphical languages like LD and FBD are parallel, while textual languages like IL and Structured Text (ST) are procedural. These differences require specific handling when converting between languages to preserve logic integrity.

### 7.3.2 Language Independence

The IEC 61131-3 standard promotes language independence by allowing program blocks to be written in different languages while maintaining interoperability. This feature is essential for creating complex systems that can be modified or extended without being tied to a specific language or vendor.

## 7.4 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential for maintaining and troubleshooting PLC systems. IEC 61131-3 programming systems typically provide various documentation features:

### 7.4.1 Cross-reference List

Cross-reference lists show where variables are declared and used throughout the program, making it easier to track dependencies and understand the impact of changes.

### 7.4.2 Allocation List (Wiring List)

Allocation lists document the mapping between symbolic variables and physical I/O addresses, facilitating hardware configuration and troubleshooting.

### 7.4.3 Comments

Extensive commenting capabilities allow programmers to document their code, improving maintainability and knowledge transfer.

## 7.5 Project Manager

The project manager component coordinates all aspects of PLC programming, including:

- Project organization and structure
- Version control and revision management
- Library management
- Configuration management
- Access control and permissions

## 7.6 Test & Commissioning Functions

### 7.6.1 Program Transfer

Efficient download and upload mechanisms for transferring programs between development environments and target PLCs.

### 7.6.2 Online Modification of a Program

The ability to make changes to running programs without stopping the PLC, crucial for maintaining continuous operation in industrial environments.

### 7.6.3 Remote Control: Starting and Stopping the PLC

Remote management capabilities for controlling PLC operation from a programming station.

### 7.6.4 Variable and Program Status

Real-time monitoring of variable values and program execution status for debugging and verification.

### 7.6.5 Forcing

The ability to override I/O values to simulate conditions and test program behavior.

### 7.6.6 Program Test

Comprehensive testing tools including breakpoints, step execution, and condition monitoring.

### 7.6.7 Testing Sequential Function Chart Programs

Specialized tools for testing SFC programs, including step activation monitoring and transition verification.

## 7.7 Data Blocks and Recipes

Support for handling structured data, including recipe management for storing and retrieving production parameters.

## 7.8 FB Interconnection

### 7.8.1 Data Exchange and Co-ordination of Blocks in Distributed Systems

Mechanisms for blocks to communicate across distributed systems, including synchronization and data consistency features.

### 7.8.2 Macro Techniques in FB Interconnection

Higher-level abstractions for creating complex networks of interconnected function blocks.

## 7.9 Diagnostics, Error Detection and Error Handling

IEC 61131-3 includes error handling concepts and extensions that help detect and recover from errors during program execution.

## 7.10 Hardware Dependence

Programming systems must address hardware-specific requirements while maintaining portability across different PLC platforms.
