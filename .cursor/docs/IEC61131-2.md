2 Building Blocks of IEC 61131-3
This chapter explains the meaning and usage of the main language elements of the IEC 61131-3 standard. These are illustrated by several examples from real life, with each example building upon the previous one. The reader is introduced to the terms and ways of thinking of IEC 61131-3. The basic ideas and concepts are explained clearly and comprehensively without discussing the formal language definitions of the standard itself [IEC 61131-3].

The first section of this chapter gives a compact introduction to the conceptual range of the standard by means of an example containing the most important language elements and providing an overview of the methodology of PLC programming with IEC 61131-3.

The term “POU” (Program Organisation Unit) is explained in detail because it is fundamental for a complete understanding of the new language concepts. As the programming language Instruction List (IL) is already well known to most PLC programmers, it has been chosen as the basis for the examples in this chapter. IL is widespread on the European PLC market and its simple syntax makes it easy to comprehend. The programming language IL itself is explained in Section 4.1.

2.1 Introduction to the New Standard
IEC 61131-3 not only describes the PLC programming languages themselves, but also offers comprehensive concepts and guidelines for creating PLC projects. The purpose of this section is to give a short summary of the important terms of the standard without going into details. These terms are illustrated by a simple example. More detailed information will be found in the subsequent sections and chapters.

2.1.1 Structure of the Building Blocks
POUs correspond to the Blocks in previous (conventional) programming systems. POUs can call each other with or without parameters. As the name implies, POUs are the smallest independent software units of a user program.

There are three types of POUs: Function (FUN), Function block (FB), and Program (PROG), in ascending order of functionality. The main difference between functions and function blocks is that functions always produce the same result (function value) when called with the same input parameters, i.e., they have no “memory.” Function blocks have their own data record and can therefore “remember” status information (instantiation). Programs (PROG) represent the “top” of a PLC user program and have the ability to access the I/Os of the PLC and to make them accessible to other POUs.

IEC 61131-3 predefines the calling interface and the behaviour of frequently needed standard functions (std. FUN) such as arithmetic or comparison functions, as well as standard function blocks (std. FB), such as timers or counters.

Declaration of Variables
The IEC 61131-3 standard uses variables to store and process information. Variables correspond to (global) flags or bit memories in conventional PLC systems. However, their storage locations no longer need to be defined manually by the user (as absolute or global addresses), but they are managed automatically by the programming system and each possess a fixed data type.

IEC 61131-3 specifies several data types (Bool, Byte, Integer, ...). These differ, for example, in the number of bits or the use of signs. It is also possible for the user to define new data types: user-defined data types such as structures and arrays.

Variables can also be assigned to a certain I/O address and can be battery-backed against power failure. Variables have different forms. They can be defined (declared) outside a POU and used program-wide, they can be declared as interface parameters of a POU, or they can have a local meaning for a POU. For declaration purposes, they are therefore divided into different variable types. All variables used by a POU have to be declared in the declaration part of the POU.

The declaration part of a POU can be written in textual form independently of the programming language used. Parts of the declaration (input and output parameters of the POU) can also be represented graphically.

VAR_INPUT (* Input variable *)
ValidFlag : BOOL; (* Binary value *)
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT (* Output variable *)
RevPM : REAL; (* Floating-point value *)
END_VAR
VAR RETAIN (* Local variable, battery-backed *)
MotorNr : INT; (* Signed integer *)
MotorName : STRING [10]; (* String of length 10 *)
EmStop AT %IX2.0 : BOOL; (* Input bit 2.0 of I/O *)
END_VAR
Example 2.1. Example of typical variable declarations of a POU

Example 2.1 shows the variable declaration part of a POU. A signed integer variable (16 bits incl. sign) with name MotorNr and a text of length 10 with name MotorName are declared. The binary variable EmStop (emergency stop) is assigned to the I/O signal input 2.0 (using the keyword “AT”). These three variables are known only within the corresponding POU, i.e., they are “local.” They can only be read and altered by this POU. During a power failure, they retain their value, as is indicated by the qualifier “RETAIN.” The value for input variable ValidFlag will be set by the calling POU and have the Boolean values TRUE or FALSE. The output parameter returned by the POU in this example is the floating-point value RevPM.

Code Part of a POU
The code part, or instruction part, follows the declaration part and contains the instructions to be processed by the PLC. A POU is programmed using either the textual programming languages Instruction List (IL) and Structured Text (ST) or the graphical languages Ladder Diagram (LD) and Function Block Diagram (FBD). IL is a programming language closer to machine code, whereas ST is a high-level language. LD is suitable for Boolean (binary) logic operations. FBD can be used for programming both Boolean (binary) and arithmetic operations in graphical representation.

Simple examples of the programming languages LD, FBD, IL and ST.

Additionally, the description language Sequential Function Chart (SFC) can be used to describe the structure of a PLC program by displaying its sequential and parallel execution. The various subdivisions of the SFC program (steps and transitions) can be programmed independently using any of the IEC 61131-3 programming languages.

2.1.2 Introductory Example Written in IL
An example of an IEC 61131-3 program is presented in this section. Figure 2.3 shows its POU calling hierarchy in tree form. This example is not formulated as an executable program, but simply serves to demonstrate POU structuring.

Calling hierarchy of POUs in the example

The equivalent IL representation is shown in Example 2.2.

PROGRAM MotorControl
VAR_INPUT (* input variable *)
MaxRPM : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR (* local variable *)

CAL Braking (* FB call *)

FUNCTION_BLOCK MotStart (* function block *)
VAR_INPUT RPM: REAL; END_VAR (* declaration of RPM*)
VAR_OUTPUT running: BOOL; END_VAR (* declaration of running*)
LD RPM
MotAccel 100.0 (* function call *)
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

FUNCTION_BLOCK MotBrake (* function block *)
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

FUNCTION MotAccel : REAL (* function *)
VAR_INPUT Param1, Param2: REAL; END_VAR (* declaration of variables*)
LD Param2
LOG (* invoc. of Std. FUN LOG *)
ST MotAccel
END_FUNCTION
Example 2.3. The three subprograms of Fig. 2.3 in IL. LOG (logarithm) is a predefined standard function of IEC 61131-3.

MotorControl is the main program. When this program is started, the variable RPM is assigned an initial value passed with the call (as will be seen later). This POU then calls the block Start (MotStart). This POU in turn calls the REAL function MotAccel with two input parameters (RPM and 100.0). This then calls LOG – the IEC 61131 standard function “Logarithm.” After processing Start (MotStart), MotorControl is activated again, evaluates the result running and then calls Braking (MotBrake).

As shown in Example 2.2, the function blocks MotStart and MotBrake are not called directly using these names, but with the so-called “instance names” Start and Braking respectively.

2.1.3 PLC Assignment
Each PLC can consist of multiple processing units, such as CPUs or special processors. These are known as resources in IEC 61131-3. Several programs can run on one resource. The programs differ in priority or execution type (periodic/cyclic or by interrupt). Each program is associated with a task, which makes it "
