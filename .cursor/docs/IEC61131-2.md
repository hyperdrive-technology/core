# Chapter 2: Building Blocks of IEC 61131-3

## 2.1 Introduction to the New Standard

IEC 61131-3 not only describes the PLC programming languages themselves, but also offers comprehensive concepts and guidelines for creating PLC projects.

This section provides a brief summary of key terms and their significance in the standard, illustrated through simple examples. More details are available in subsequent sections and chapters.

### 2.1.1 Structure of the Building Blocks

Program Organization Units (POUs) in IEC 61131-3 correspond to program blocks in traditional PLC systems. POUs can call each other with or without parameters and are the smallest independent software units.

There are three types of POUs:

- **Function (FUN)**: Produces the same result when called with the same input parameters (stateless).
- **Function Block (FB)**: Stores internal data and retains state between calls (stateful).
- **Program (PROG)**: Represents the top level of a PLC program and interacts with I/O.

IEC 61131-3 also defines **standard functions (std. FUN)** and **standard function blocks (std. FB)** for common tasks like arithmetic operations and timers.

#### Declaration of Variables

IEC 61131-3 uses variables to store and process information. Variables no longer require manual memory assignments but are managed automatically by the programming system.

Examples of variable declarations:

```plaintext
VAR_INPUT
    ValidFlag : BOOL; (* Binary value *)
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    RevPM : REAL; (* Floating-point value *)
END_VAR

VAR RETAIN
    MotorNr : INT; (* Signed integer *)
    MotorName : STRING [10]; (* String of length 10 *)
    EmStop AT %IX2.0 : BOOL; (* Input bit 2.0 of I/O *)
END_VAR
```

#### Code Part of a POU

The **code part** follows the declaration part and contains instructions to be executed by the PLC. It can be written using:

- **Instruction List (IL)** (low-level, machine-like)
- **Structured Text (ST)** (high-level, similar to Pascal)
- **Ladder Diagram (LD)** (Boolean logic)
- **Function Block Diagram (FBD)** (graphical logic representation)

Sequential Function Chart (SFC) is also used to describe sequential and parallel execution structures.

### 2.1.2 Example Program

An example IEC 61131-3 program is structured as follows:

```
PROGRAM MotorControl
VAR_INPUT
    MaxRPM : REAL;
END_VAR
VAR
    Start : MotStart;
    Braking : MotBrake;
END_VAR

CAL Start (RPM := MaxRPM)
LD Start.running
CAL Braking
END_PROGRAM
```

### 2.1.3 PLC Assignment

Each PLC can consist of multiple **resources** (CPUs, special processors) that execute tasks. Tasks define execution priority and scheduling for programs.

Example configuration:

```
CONFIGURATION MotorCon
VAR_GLOBAL
    Trigger AT %IX2.3 : BOOL;
END_VAR

RESOURCE Res_1 ON CPU001
    TASK T_1 (INTERVAL := t#80ms, PRIORITY := 4);
    PROGRAM MotR WITH T_1 : MotorControl (MaxRPM := 12000);
END_RESOURCE
END_CONFIGURATION
```

## 2.2 The Program Organization Unit (POU)

POUs represent encapsulated software modules. IEC 61131-3 defines three types:

| POU Type       | Keyword          | Description                             |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Program        | `PROGRAM`        | Main program, interacts with I/O        |
| Function Block | `FUNCTION_BLOCK` | Stateful module with inputs and outputs |
| Function       | `FUNCTION`       | Stateless module, returns a value       |

## 2.3 Elements of a POU

A POU consists of:

- **Declaration part**: Defines variables (input, output, internal)
- **Code part**: Contains program logic

Example function block:

```plaintext
FUNCTION_BLOCK NextState
VAR_INPUT
    VarIn : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    VarOut1 : BYTE;
    VarOut2 : BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR
    VarLocal : BYTE;
END_VAR

LD VarIn
ST VarOut1
LD VarLocal
ST VarOut2
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

## Conclusion

Chapter 2 introduces the core building blocks of IEC 61131-3, including POUs, variable declarations, and execution structures. These concepts provide a foundation for effective PLC programming under the standard.
