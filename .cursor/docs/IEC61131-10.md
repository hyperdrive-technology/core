### Title

10.1 IEC Programming Systems STEP 7 and OpenPCS

### Introduction

The DVD and CD-ROM enclosed in this book contain the following information, examples and programs:

### Contents List

- 1. DVD: STEP 7 Professional 2006 SR5 Engineering Software for SIMATIC S7 / M7 / C7 1 as a system for PLC programming with IEC 61131-3 using the languages: IL, KOP, FUP, S7-GRAPH and S7-SCL as well as PLC simulation PLCSIM and the add-on iMAP. The package is completed with the Automation License Manager and electronic manuals; running under Windows XP Professional SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2 standard edition and Windows Vista 32 Bit Ultimate/Business with/without SP1.
- 2. CD-ROM: Open PCS, a system (full version) for programming with IEC 61131-3 , running on any standard Windows PC, using the languages: IL, LD, FBD, SFC, ST and CFC2; running under Windows Server 2003, Windows XP SP2 or Windows Vista 32bit. PLC simulation SmartPLC is available for simulating the programs on a PC. The dedicated OPC server SmartPLC/OPC is only required, if additional third-party hardware and/or external OPC clients are connected.
- 3. CD-ROM: Examples of this book as source files,
- 4. CD-ROM: Buyer's Guide for IEC 61131-3-compliant programming systems.

### Readme Info

- File README.TXT on the CD contains important information about the installation and use of the files and programs. It shows how to copy the files onto hard disk and gives tips on how to use the examples and the buyer's guide.
- README.TXT is an ASCII file and can be read using any text editor.
- The files of the two programming systems are either self-extracting or in the form of an installation package, i.e. they cannot be read immediately but must first be decompressed or installed. No additional software is needed.

### Footnotes

- 1 IL corresponds to STL, FUP to FBS, KOP to LD, S7-GRAPH to SFC, and S7-SCL to ST
- 2 CFC: not part of IEC 61131-3

### Demo Versions

#### Title

Demo versions of STEP 7 (Siemens, www.siemens.com) and OpenPCS (infoteam, www.infoteam.de)

#### Paragraphs

- With the aid of the above-mentioned versions of two selected programming systems, readers can program, modify, extend and test all examples in this book or create programs of their own in order to practise PLC programming with IEC 61131-3.
- STEP 7 Professional includes the programming languages as well as a PLC simulation S7-PLCSIM, which allows testing of programs without physical hardware. OpenPCS contains all IEC 61131-3 programming languages, the programming language CFC as well as a run-time package Smart PLC/SIM, which additionally allows execution of a PLC program on PC (offline simulation), and the OPC server SmartPLC/OPC.
- Hints on using and purchasing commercially available software versions of both programming systems (as well as hardware) can also be found in the relevant folders on the CD and/or DVD.
- The authors are not responsible for the contents and correct functioning of these programming versions. These software packages have a partly restricted scope compared with the functionality of the corresponding products. Their use is only allowed in conjunction with this book for learning and training purposes.

### Il Examples

#### Title

IL examples

#### Paragraph

To save the reader having to re-type the programming examples in this book, the most important IL examples are provided on the CD. Further information about these can also be found in README.TXT.

## Section 10 2

### Title

10.2 Buyer's Guide for IEC 61131-3 PLC Programming Systems

### Paragraphs

- The CD-ROM also contains a buyer's guide as a file in the format “Word for Windows (1997-2003, 2007)”.
- Contents of the buyer's guide (file BuyGuide.doc):
- Buyer's Guide for IEC 61131-3 PLC Programming Systems Checklists for evaluation of PLC programming systems Using the checklists Checklists for PLC programming systems Compliance with IEC 61131-3 Language scope, decompilation and cross-compilation Tools Working environment, openness, documentation General, costs
- This buyer's guide essentially consists of tables, or “checklists”, which permit objective evaluation of PLC programming systems compliant with the standard IEC 61131-3. The use of these lists is described in detail before explaining each criterion for PLC programming systems.
- The file can be copied for multiple product evaluation and individual editing of the checklists. These tables are stored on the CD in three different file formats:
- 1. Microsoft Word for Windows (1997-2003, 2007) (file TABLES.DOC), 2) Microsoft Excel for Windows (1997-2003, 2007) (file TABLES.XLS), 3) RTF text (file TABLES.RTF).
- The Excel version is advantageous, as all calculations can be done automatically.
