# Chapter 6: State-of-the-Art PLC Configuration

IEC 61131-3 incorporates modern concepts that allow the modeling of PLC projects consisting of more than just single-processor applications.

The software model of IEC 61131-3 allows for practice-oriented structuring (modularization) of applications into units (POUs). This approach eases maintenance, documentation, and improves diagnostics for PLC programs.

A uniform software architecture is essential for the portability of applications. The resources of PLCs are given explicit run-time properties, building a platform for hardware-independent programs.

## 6.1 Structuring Projects with Configuration Elements
The following sections explain the configuration elements of IEC 61131-3, which are crucial for structuring applications and defining the interaction of POUs. Configuration elements describe the run-time properties of programs, communication paths, and the assignment to PLC hardware.

IEC 61131-3 configuration elements support the use of today’s sophisticated operating systems for PLCs. The CPU of a typical PLC today can run multiple programs at the same time (multitasking).

## 6.2 Elements of a Real-World PLC Configuration
The configuration is essential for structuring PLC projects and assigning tasks. This section introduces key configuration elements:

CONFIGURATION: The overarching declaration for a PLC setup.
RESOURCE: Assigns resources (e.g., CPUs) to specific tasks.
TASK: Defines the run-time behavior for tasks, including priority and timing.
PROGRAM: The individual programs within the task, executed at run-time.

## 6.3 Configuration Elements
This section provides further details on configuration elements such as ACCESS declarations, which define communication paths between configurations.

### 6.3.1 Definitions
Access paths extend the scope of global variables, allowing them to be accessed across configurations. Variables within one configuration are made available to others through symbolic names.

Example 6.4 shows how a variable is accessed from an external configuration.

```iec
VAR_ACCESS
CONV_EMPTY : CPU_Hammer.%IX1.0  : BOOL READ_ONLY;
END_VAR
```

### 6.3.2 Access Paths
Access paths are defined in the VAR_ACCESS declaration.

### 6.4 Configuration Example
Example 6.5 provides an overview of a PLC system configuration consisting of two CPUs. These CPUs are assigned several programs and function blocks as run-time programs. Some parts of this example have been covered in earlier sections of this chapter.

#### Configuration Overview
The system is designed as follows:

```iec
CONFIGURATION PLC_Cell1

VAR_GLOBAL
    ErrorCode : DUINT;
    AT %MW3 : WORD;
    Start : INT;
END_VAR

RESOURCE CPU_Conveyor ON CPU_001
    TASK T_Quick (INTERVAL := t#8ms, PRIORITY := 1);
    TASK T_Cyclic (INTERVAL := t#20ms, PRIORITY := 3);
    PROGRAM Motion WITH T_Quick : ProgA (RegPar := %MW3);
    PROGRAM Control WITH T_Cyclic : ProgB (InOut := Start, R_Val => ErrorCode,
        FB1 WITH T_Quick, FB2 WITH T_Cyclic);
END_RESOURCE

RESOURCE CPU_Hammer ON CPU_002
    VAR_GLOBAL
        Trigger AT %IX2.5 : BOOL;
    END_VAR
    TASK T_Interrupt (SINGLE := Trigger, PRIORITY := 1);
    PROGRAM Lube WITH T_Interrupt : ProgC;
END_RESOURCE

VAR_ACCESS
    RegP : CPU_Conveyor.Motion.RegPar : WORD READ_WRITE;
    CONV_EMPTY : CPU_Hammer.%IX1.0 : BOOL READ_ONLY;
END_VAR

VAR_CONFIG
    CPU_Conveyor.Motion.RegPar.C2 AT QB17 : BYTE;
END_VAR

END_CONFIGURATION
```

This textual declaration defines a configuration named PLC_Cell1, which contains two resources: CPU_Conveyor and CPU_Hammer. Each resource has associated tasks and programs, with T_Quick and T_Cyclic defining periodic tasks for specific programs, while T_Interrupt triggers a program on a different CPU.

### 6.5 Communication between Configurations and POUs
Communication between different configurations or within a single configuration occurs through shared data areas. IEC 61131-3 defines several methods to exchange data across programs, resources, and configurations, which includes:

Directly represented variables (%I, %Q, %M),
Global variables (VAR_GLOBAL, VAR_EXTERNAL),
Access paths (VAR_ACCESS),
Communication blocks (as defined in IEC 61131-5).
These methods help ensure data flow and synchronization, aiding the diagnostic and commissioning processes.

#### Table 6.3: Communication Methods
| Method | CONF | RES | PROG | FB | FUN |
|--------|------|-----|------|----|----|
| Access path | ✔ | ✔ | | | |
| Directly represented | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | |
| Global variable | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | |
| External variable | ✔ | | ✔ | ✔ | |
| Communication block | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Call parameter | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

These communication tools enable modularized, reusable programs while maintaining standardization across different PLC systems.
