# Appendix G: IL Syntax Example

Many of the examples given in this book are formulated in Instruction List (IL). This programming language is widely used and is supported by most programming systems. By including data types previously only found in high-level languages, such as arrays or structures, the IEC 61131-3 Instruction List language opens up new possibilities compared with conventional IL.

The IL syntax descriptions in this appendix are presented in simplified form in syntax diagrams.

## G.1 Syntax Diagrams for IL

Syntax diagrams explain the permissible use of delimiters, keywords, literals, and names in a readily comprehensible format. They can easily be put into textual form for the development of compilers and define the formal structure of a programming language (syntax of a language).

The syntax descriptions in this appendix go beyond IEC 61131-3 because, in addition to the pure syntax definitions, they also include semantic conditions (consistent use of the current result, use of function parameters, etc.). IEC 61131-3 only offers an informal description of this.

### IL instruction sequence:

An IL instruction sequence begins optionally with a (jump) label. This is followed either by a Load instruction followed by one or more conditional instructions (ConInst), an unconditional instruction with FB call, a jump, or a return.

### Label:

A label consists of a label identifier, followed by a colon. It either immediately precedes the first instruction of the sequence or is followed by end-of-line characters (EOLs).

### Instruction without brackets (InstWoutBrck):

An instruction without brackets consists of an IL operator with one operand and the end-of-line EOLs.

### Instruction with brackets (InstWithBrck):

This type of instruction begins with an instruction consisting of an operator followed by an opening bracket and an operand. This can be followed by any number of instructions inside the brackets, which are concluded with a closing bracket and EOLs.

These inner instructions can themselves contain brackets (nesting), as well as FUN calls and assignments.

### Function call:

A function call consists of the function name together with a number of operands separated by commas as actual parameters of the function. Like a function block, a function can also be called with formal parameters.

### Function block call:

There are different syntax diagrams for conditional and unconditional calls of a function block. The unconditional call begins with CAL, the conditional call with CALC or CALCN. This is followed by the name of the FB instance, and the FB parameters in brackets.

The assignment of an actual parameter to a formal parameter is represented by the symbol ":=". Such assignments are required for every parameter and are separated by commas.

### Jumps:

For jumps, the label name is specified after the jump operator JMP (unconditional) or JMPC/JMPCN (conditional).

### Return:

Returns have no operands or parameters.

### Load instruction:

The Load instruction has a single (negatable) operand. It cannot be combined with a bracket or used inside a bracket.

### Assignment:

Assignments consist of the operator ST or STN and the specification of the operand to be stored.

### S/R instruction:

An S/R instruction consists of the IL operators S or R and one operand.

### Operators:

Operators perform logic operations and are not used for loading or storage. A distinction is made between extensible and non-extensible operators:

- **Extensible operators:** AND, OR, XOR, ADD, MUL (can have inversion variants like ANDN, ORN, XORN)
- **Non-extensible operators:** GT, LT, EQ, NE, GE, LE, SUB, DIV, MOD, NOT

## G.2 IL Example from Syntax Diagrams

The following IL example demonstrates how sample programs are constructed from syntax diagrams:

```
SequenceOne: (* label *)
    (* simple logic operation with jump *)
    LD Var1 (* load instruction *)
    (* beginning of conditional instructions *)
    ANDN Var2 (* instruction without bracket *)
    ORN ( Var3 (* instruction with bracket *)
        AND Var4
    ) (* end of bracketing *)
    AND Var5
    ST Var6 (* assignment *)
    S Var7 (* S/R instruction *)
    RETC (* conditional return *)
    (* end of conditional instructions *)
(* end of IL sequence *)
```

This example shows how a concrete IL program is built up using syntax diagrams. In the syntax diagram for an IL instruction sequence, first the label with name, colon, and comments is inserted, followed by the first (Load) instruction.

The "conditional instructions" part is made up of two instructions, the first of which with a bracket containing further instructions. After the conditional instructions, the sequence is terminated with assignments and return.

In this way, it is possible to create valid IL sequences from the individual syntax diagrams. Conversely, the relevant syntax diagrams for each IL line can be found in order to determine whether a program section is syntactically correct.
