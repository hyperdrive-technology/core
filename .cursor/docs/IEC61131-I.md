# Appendix I: Glossary

This appendix provides definitions for important terms and abbreviations used in IEC 61131-3 programming. Terms defined by the IEC 61131-3 standard are marked as "IEC".

## A

**Action** (IEC): Boolean variable or a series of statements which can be accessed via an action block (in SFC).

**Action block** (IEC): Activation description of actions (in SFC) using an associated control structure.

**Action control** (IEC): Control unit for every action in SFC which is supplied with the input condition for activating the assigned action by means of one or more action blocks; also: action control block.

**Actual parameter**: Actual value for an input variable (formal parameter) of a POU.

**Allocation list**: List which contains the assignment of all symbols or symbolic variables to PLC addresses.

**Array**: Sequence of elements of the same data type.

## B

**Block**: Programming unit, from which PLC-programs are built. Blocks can often be loaded independently from each other into the PLC, see also POU. Also referred to as sub-program in other programming languages.

## C

**Cold restart** (IEC): Restart of the PLC-system and its application program, whereby all variables and memory areas (such as internal registers, timers, counters) are (newly) initialized with predefined values. This process can occur automatically after specific events (e.g., after a power failure) or also manually by the user (e.g., Reset button).

**Comment** (IEC): Text written between parentheses and asterisks used to explain the program (cannot be nested!). This is not interpreted by the programming system.

**Configuration** (IEC): Language element CONFIGURATION which corresponds to a PLC system.

**CPU**: Abbreviation for Central Processing Unit (e.g., of a PLC).

**CR**: Abbreviation for Current Result.

**Cross-compilation**: Conversion of the representation of a POU from one programming language to another, typically between ladder and function block diagram, but also between textual and graphical languages; also: cross-compiling.

**Current result** (IEC): Interim result in IL of any data type.

**Cycle**: A single run of the (periodically called) application program.

**Cycle time**: The time which an application program requires for one cycle; also: scan time.

## D

**Data block**: Shared data area, which is accessible throughout a program, see also block. In IEC 61131-3, there is no direct analogy. They are replaced here by global (non-local), structured data areas and FB instance data areas.

**Data type**: Defines properties of a variable as bit length and value range.

**Declaration**: Definition of variables and FB instances takes place in a declaration block with information about the data name, the data type or the FB type as well as appropriate initial values, range specification and array attributes (data template declaration). The definition or programming of POUs is also designated as a declaration since their interfaces are made known to the programming system here.

**Declaration block** (IEC): Combination of declarations of one variable type at the beginning of the POU.

**Derived data type** (IEC): With the aid of a type definition, a user-specific data type is created. Its elements are elementary data types or derived data types.

**Directly represented variable** (IEC): Variable without further name which corresponds to a hierarchical address.

## E

**Edge**: The 0→1 transition of a Boolean variable is known as "rising edge". Accordingly, the 1→0 transition is known as "falling" edge.

**Elementary data type** (IEC): A standard data type predefined by IEC 61131-3.

**Enumeration**: Special data type for the definition of a range of textual sequences. Mostly implemented internally as integer values.

## F

**FB** (IEC): Abbreviation for function block.

**FB instance** (IEC): See instance.

**FB type** (IEC): Name of a function block with call and return interface.

**FBD** (IEC): Abbreviation for Function Block Diagram.

**Formal parameter**: Name or placeholder of an input variable (all POUs) or output variable (function block and program).

**Function** (IEC): A POU of type FUNCTION.

**Function block** (IEC): A POU of type FUNCTION_BLOCK.

**Function Block Diagram** (IEC): Function Block Diagram (FBD) is a programming language used to describe networks with Boolean, arithmetic, and similar elements, working together concurrently.

## G

**Generic data type** (IEC): Combination of elementary data types into groups using the prefix 'ANY', in order to describe overloaded functions.

## H

**Hierarchical address** (IEC): Physical slot address of I/O modules of a PLC system (see also I/O).

**Hot restart** (IEC): Program restart at the place in the program where a power failure occurred. All battery-backed data areas as well as the application program context will be restored and the program can go on running, as if there had been no power failure. In contrast to warm restart, the interruption duration must be within a given value range depending on the process. For this purpose, the PLC system must have a separately secured real-time clock in order to be able to compute the interruption duration.

## I

**I/O**: The addresses of input and output modules belonging to a PLC system with hierarchical addresses.

**IL** (IEC): Abbreviation for Instruction List.

**Indirect FB call**: Call of an FB instance whose name is passed to the POU as a VAR_IN_OUT parameter.

**Initial value**: Value of a variable, which will be assigned during initialization, i.e., at system start-up time; also: starting count.

**Instance** (IEC): Structured data set of an FB obtained by declaration of a function block indicating the FB type.

**Instruction List** (IEC): Instruction List (IL) is a much used Assembler-like programming language for PLC systems.

## L

**Ladder Diagram** (IEC): Ladder Diagram (LD) is a programming language to describe networks with Boolean and electromechanical elements, such as contacts and coils, working together concurrently.

**LD** (IEC): Abbreviation for Ladder Diagram.

## M

**Multi-element variable** (IEC): Variable of type array or structure, which is put together from several different data types.

## N

**New start**: See Cold restart.

## O

**Overloading of functions** (IEC): The capability of an operation or function to operate with different input data types (but each of the same type). By this means several function classes are available under the same name.

## P

**PC**: Abbreviation for personal computer. Also Abbreviation for Programmable Controllers as employed in IEC 61131.

**PLC**: Abbreviation for Programmable Logic Controller.

**PLC programming computer**: Unit consisting of computer, programming system, and other peripherals for programming the PLC.

**PLC system**: All hardware, firmware, and operating system parts required for executing a PLC program.

**POU** (IEC): Abbreviation for program organization unit.

**Pragma**: Pragmas are offered by the programming system and are typically employed for program pre-processing and post-processing.

**Programming computer**: See PLC programming computer.

**Programming system**: See PLC programming system.

## R

**Range specification**: Specification of a permissible range of values for a data type or a variable.

**Recursion**: Illegal in IEC 61131-3. It means: a) the declaration of an FB using its own name or FB type, b) mutual FB calls. Recursion is considered an error and must be recognized while programming and/or at run time.

**Resource** (IEC): Language element RESOURCE which corresponds to a central processing unit of the PLC system.

**Retentive data** (IEC): Ability of a PLC to protect specific process data against loss during a power failure. The keyword RETAIN is used for this in IEC 61131-3.
