# Appendix E: Causes of Error

This appendix summarizes common errors encountered in IEC 61131-3 programming and their causes.

## E.1 Compile-Time Errors

| Error Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Syntax Error | Incorrect structure of program elements | Missing END_IF in an IF statement |
| Type Mismatch | Incompatible data types in expressions | Assigning a STRING to an INT variable |
| Undefined Variable | Reference to a variable that hasn't been declared | Using X when X hasn't been declared |
| Duplicate Declaration | Declaring the same variable multiple times | Declaring Counter twice in the same scope |
| Invalid Parameter | Incorrect parameter usage in function calls | Calling a function with too many parameters |
| Out of Range | Constant or literal outside the valid range | Assigning 300 to a USINT variable |
| Invalid Identifier | Using reserved keywords as identifiers | Naming a variable "END_VAR" |
| Invalid Array Index | Array index out of the declared bounds | Accessing array[11] when declared as [1..10] |
| Invalid Structure Access | Incorrect access to structure members | Accessing a non-existent structure field |
| Invalid Function Block | Error in function block instantiation | Instantiating undefined function block |
| Missing Return Value | Function without a return value assignment | Function ends without assigning return value |
| Recursion Error | Direct or indirect recursive calls | A function calling itself directly or indirectly |

## E.2 Run-Time Errors

| Error Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Division by Zero | Attempting to divide by zero | X := A / 0 |
| Overflow | Result exceeds the range of the data type | SINT := 120 + 10 |
| Underflow | Result is smaller than the minimum allowed value | SINT := -120 - 10 |
| Conversion Error | Error during data type conversion | Converting an invalid string to a number |
| Array Bounds Violation | Accessing array elements outside bounds | Run-time computed index outside array bounds |
| Access Violation | Invalid memory access | Accessing uninitialized pointer |
| Task Overrun | Task exceeds its allocated time | Long computation in a cyclic task |
| Stack Overflow | Function call nesting too deep | Multiple nested function calls |
| Memory Allocation Failure | Not enough memory | Creating large arrays or structures |
| Communication Error | Error in data exchange | Network timeout or transmission error |
| Hardware Error | Problem with physical I/O | Sensor failure or wiring issue |

## E.3 Logical Errors

Logical errors don't cause compiler errors or runtime exceptions but lead to incorrect program behavior:

| Error Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Logic Flow Error | Incorrect program flow logic | Wrong conditions in IF statements |
| State Machine Error | Incorrect state transitions | Missing or incorrect state transitions |
| Timing Error | Incorrect timing calculations | Wrong timer settings or comparison |
| Boundary Condition | Failure to handle edge cases | Not handling zero or negative inputs |
| Initialization Error | Variables not properly initialized | Using variables before setting values |
| Race Condition | Timing-dependent errors | Multiple accesses to shared variables |
| Off-by-One Error | Counting error, often by one | Loop running one iteration too many or few |
| Comparison Error | Using wrong comparison operators | Using < instead of <= |
| Priority Error | Wrong priority in expression evaluation | Missing parentheses in complex expressions |
| Feedback Path Error | Incorrect feedback logic | Missing or incorrect signal feedback |

## E.4 Best Practices to Avoid Errors

1. **Use strong typing**: Explicitly define and verify data types
2. **Initialize variables**: Always provide initial values
3. **Use structured programming**: Proper organization of programs and code blocks
4. **Document code**: Use comments to explain logic and assumptions
5. **Implement error handling**: Check for error conditions and handle exceptions
6. **Test thoroughly**: Cover all possible execution paths and edge cases
7. **Review code**: Have others review your code for potential issues
8. **Use simulation**: Test program behavior in simulated environments
9. **Apply modular design**: Use well-defined interfaces between components
10. **Follow naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables and POUs
