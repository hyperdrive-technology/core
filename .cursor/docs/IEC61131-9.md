# Chapter 9: Programming by Configuring with IEC 61499

## 9.1 Programming by FB Interconnection with IEC 61131-3

IEC 61131-3 introduced the concept of function blocks as reusable software components with encapsulated data and behavior. This approach allows programs to be constructed by interconnecting function blocks, creating data flow networks that define the system's behavior. However, IEC 61131-3 has limitations when addressing distributed systems and event-driven applications.

## 9.2 IEC 61499 â€“ The Programming Standard for Distributed PLC Systems

IEC 61499 extends the function block concept to address the challenges of distributed automation systems. It provides a component-based architecture that separates event flow from data flow, enabling more flexible and responsive distributed applications.

### 9.2.1 System Model

The IEC 61499 system model defines a hierarchical structure:

- System: The top-level entity comprising multiple devices connected via communication networks
- Devices: Physical processing units that host resources
- Resources: Execution environments that contain function block networks
- Applications: Distributed across multiple resources and devices

This model provides a clear framework for designing distributed automation systems.

### 9.2.2 Device Model

A device in IEC 61499 represents a physical processing unit with:

- Process interface for connecting to sensors and actuators
- Communication interface for network connectivity
- Resources that host function block networks
- Device management functions for configuration and monitoring

Devices can range from simple controllers to complex processing units.

### 9.2.3 Resource Model

Resources are execution environments within devices that:

- Provide scheduling services for function blocks
- Manage event and data connections
- Support application loading and configuration
- Maintain isolation between different applications

Multiple resources can exist on a single device, allowing for separation of concerns.

### 9.2.4 Application Model

An application in IEC 61499 consists of:

- Function block networks that define behavior
- Event connections that control execution flow
- Data connections that define information exchange
- Distribution across multiple resources and devices

Applications can span multiple devices, enabling truly distributed automation solutions.

### 9.2.5 Function Block Model

The IEC 61499 function block differs significantly from its IEC 61131-3 counterpart:

- Event inputs and outputs control execution
- Data inputs and outputs exchange information
- Execution Control Chart (ECC) defines internal behavior
- Algorithms implement specific functionality

This model separates control flow (events) from data flow, providing more flexibility for distributed and event-driven applications.

#### Composite Function Blocks

Composite function blocks encapsulate networks of other function blocks, enabling hierarchical design:

- Internal function block network
- Event and data connections between internal blocks
- Mapping of internal connections to external interfaces
- Encapsulation of complex functionality

This approach supports modular design and reuse of complex components.

### 9.2.6 Creating an Application

Application development with IEC 61499 involves:

1. Defining the system architecture (devices and resources)
2. Creating function block types or using standard libraries
3. Designing function block networks
4. Configuring event and data connections
5. Distributing the application across resources
6. Deploying to target devices

This process emphasizes configuration over traditional programming, making it more accessible for automation engineers.

## 9.3 Overview of the Parts of IEC 61499

The IEC 61499 standard consists of multiple parts:

- Part 1: Architecture - Defines the core concepts and models
- Part 2: Software tool requirements - Specifies requirements for development tools
- Part 3: Tutorial information - Provides guidance and examples
- Part 4: Rules for compliance profiles - Establishes conformance criteria

These parts together provide a comprehensive framework for distributed automation systems.

IEC 61499 represents an evolution of industrial automation programming, addressing the growing need for distributed, flexible, and reconfigurable systems. While adoption has been gradual, it offers significant advantages for complex automation applications, particularly those involving multiple controllers and distributed intelligence.
