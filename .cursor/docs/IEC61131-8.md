8 Main Advantages of IEC 61131-3

## Introduction

- Chapter 1 outlines goals and benefits of IEC 61131-3 for manufacturers and users. How well does this programming standard live up to expectations?
- Many features and concepts of this way of programming PLCs have been described and explained in previous chapters. The core concepts are summarised again here.
- The following outstanding features of PLC programming with IEC 61131-3 deserve special notice:
- -Convenience and security with variables and data types, -Blocks with extended capabilities, -PLC configuration with run-time behaviour, -Uniform programming languages, -Structured PLC programs, -Trend towards open programming systems.

## Section 8 1

### Title

8.1 Convenience and Security with Variables and Data Types

### Local Global Variables

#### Title

Local and global variables instead of hardware addresses

#### Paragraph

Formerly, all data memory of a PLC was accessed using global addresses, and the programmer had to take care that one part of a program did not overwrite the data of another part. This applied particularly to I/O addresses, flags and data blocks.
IEC 61131-3 replaces all global hardware addresses by named variables with a defined scope: the programming system automatically distinguishes between global variables and variables local to a POU. Global addresses can be accessed by assigning the address to a named variable in the declaration part and using this variable in the program.

### Type Oriented Access

#### Title

Type-oriented access to PLC data

#### Paragraph

PLC programmers used to have to be careful to use the same data type when reading or writing to individual PLC addresses. It was possible to interpret the same memory location as an integer at one place in a program, and as a floating-point number at another.
IEC 61131-3 prevents such programming errors from occurring, as each variable (including direct hardware addresses) must be assigned a data type. The programming system can then check, that all accesses use the proper data type.

### Defined Initial Values

#### Title

Defined initial values for user data

#### Paragraph

All data is explicitly declared in the form of a variable, and assigned a data type in the declaration. Each data type has, either by default or as specified by the user, a defined initial value, so each and every variable used in a program is always correctly initialised in accordance with its properties.
Variables can be declared to be retentive (with a RETAIN qualifier). They are then automatically assigned to a battery-backed area of memory by the programming system.

### Arrays Data Structures

#### Title

Arrays and data structures for every application

#### Paragraph

Building on the predefined data types, the PLC programmer can design arrays and other complex data structures to match the application, as is the practice with high level languages.
Limits of array indices and ranges of variable values are checked by the programming system as well as by the PLC system at run time.

### Unified Declaration

#### Title

Unified declaration of variables

#### Paragraph

The extensive facilities for using variables are generally identical in all the languages defined by IEC 61131.

## Section 8 2

### Title

8.2 Blocks with Extended Capabilities

### Reuse of Blocks

#### Title

Reuse of blocks

#### Paragraphs

- Blocks (POUs), such as functions and function blocks, can be designed to be independent of the target system used. This makes it possible to have libraries of reusable blocks, available for multiple platforms.
- Parameters of a function block instances, input as well as output, and local data of each function block instance, keep their values between calls. Each instance of a function block has its own data area in memory, where it can perform its calculations independently of external data. It is not necessary to call a data block for the FB to work on.
- Programs can also be used in several instances and be assigned to different tasks of one CPU.

### Efficient Assignment

#### Title

Efficient assignment of block parameters

#### Paragraph

The standard provides a variety of mechanisms for passing data to and from blocks:

#### Mechanisms List

- VAR_INPUT: Value of a variable
- VAR_IN_OUT: Pointer to a variable (reference)
- VAR_OUTPUT: Return value
- VAR_EXTERNAL: Global variable of another POU
- VAR_ACCESS: Access path within a configuration.

#### Paragraph After List

Until now, the only items in this list that have been provided by most PLC systems have been global variables and the capability for passing values to a called block (but not for returning a value).

### Standardised Functionality

#### Title

Standardised PLC functionality

#### Paragraph

To standardise typical PLC functionality, IEC 61131-3 defines a set of standard functions and function blocks. The calling interface, the graphical layout and the run-time behaviour of these is strictly defined by the standard.
This standard “library” for PLC systems is an important foundation for uniform and manufacturer-independent training, programming and documentation.

## Section 8 3

### Title

8.3 PLC Configuration with Run-Time Behaviour

### Configurations Structure

#### Title

Configurations structure PLC projects

#### Paragraph

Tasks and programs are assigned to the controller hardware at the highest level of a PLC project (the configuration). This is where the run-time properties, interfaces to the outside, PLC addresses and I/Os are defined for the various program parts.

### Runtime Features

#### Title

Run-time features for PLC programs

#### Paragraph

Until now, the methods of specifying run-time properties, like cycle time and priority of programs, have often been system-specific. With IEC 61131-3, such parameters can be specified and documented individually by defining tasks.
PLC programs must not be recursive. The amount of memory required to hold the program at run time can therefore be determined off-line, and the programs are protected from unintentional recursion.

## Section 8 4

### Title

8.4 Uniform Programming Languages

### Paragraphs

- IEC 61131-3 defines five programming languages, which can cover a wide range of applications.
- As a result of this international standard, PLC specialists will in future receive more uniform training, and will “speak the same language” wherever they are employed.
- The cost of training will be reduced, as only specific features of each new controller system have to be learned.
- Documentation will be more uniform, even if hardware from more than one vendor is being used.

## Section 8 5

### Title

8.5 Structured PLC Programs

### Paragraphs

- The various language elements of IEC 61131-3 allow clear structuring of applications, from definitions of blocks and data up to the hardware configuration.
- This supports structured programming (top-down and bottom-up) and facilitates service and maintenance of applications.
- The “structuring language”, Sequential Function Chart, also enables users to formulate complex automation tasks clearly and in an application-oriented way.

## Section 8 6

### Title

8.6 Trend towards Open PLC Programming Systems

### Paragraphs

- Standardisation of programming languages leads to standardisation of software, which makes vendor-independent, portable programs feasible, as is, for example, already the case in the personal computer domain with programming languages like Assembler, PASCAL, COBOL and, most notably, C. The “feature tables” of IEC 61131-3 provide a basis for comparing programming systems with the same basic functionality from different vendors. There will still be differences between the systems of different manufacturers, but these will mainly be found in additional tools like logic analysers or off-line simulation, rather than in the programming languages themselves.
- The common look and feel in PLC programming is becoming more and more international and bring the separate markets in Europe, the US or Asia closer together.

#### Title

Figure 8.1. Trend towards open, standardised components built on IEC 61131-3-compliant programming systems

### Paragraphs After Figure 8 1

- The new generation of PLC programming systems will have a standardised basic functionality, plus highly sophisticated additional tools to cover a wide range of applications.
- As shown in Figure 8.1, standardisation by IEC 61131-3 promotes integrated systems, built from standardised components like editors, compilers, export and import utilities, with open, re-usable interfaces.
- Tools which are traditionally sold as separate packages, like HMI, simulation or visualisation, will cause de facto interface standards to be established for these components.

## Section 8 7

### Title

8.7 Conclusion

### Paragraphs

- IEC 61131-3 will cause PLC manufacturers and users to give up old habits for a new, state-of-the-art programming technology. A comprehensive standard like IEC 61131 was necessary to achieve a uniform environment for innovating the configuration and programming of PLC systems.
- This manufacturer-independent standard will reduce the training and familiarisation time for PLC programmers, programs written will be more reliable, and the functionality of PLC systems will catch up with the powerful software development environments available for PCs today.
- Compliance with IEC 61131-3, migration paths from legacy systems towards the new architectures, and a powerful, ergonomic user interface will be the most important criteria for users for a wide acceptance of the new generation of PLC programming systems.
- Today’s complex requirements and economic constraints will lead to flexible, open, and therefore manufacturer-independent PLC programming systems.
