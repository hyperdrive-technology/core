# Hyperdrive

Hyperdrive is a modern, open-source PLC runtime with support for IEC 61131-3 programming languages and online changes.

ðŸš§ This repo is still under construction. ðŸš§

## Features

- Full support for IEC 61131-3 programming languages
- Real-time control and monitoring
- Online program changes
- WebSocket-based communication for UI updates
- Modern React-based UI with Monaco-powered editor
- Deploy to embedded devices, desktop or cloud
- Comprehensive documentation

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 23.6+
- Go 1.24+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Gokrazy (for runtime deployment)
- Caddy (for SSL and reverse proxy)

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperdrive-technology/hyperdrive.git
cd hyperdrive
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development environment:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Access the applications:

- UI: http://localhost:8080
- Documentation: http://localhost:3002
- Website: http://localhost:3001
- IDE: http://localhost:3003

## Deployment

### Runtime Deployment with Gokrazy

The Go-based runtime can be deployed to embedded devices using Gokrazy, a minimal Go-only operating system.

Install Gokrazy:

```bash
go install github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gokr-packer@latest
```

Build and deploy the runtime:

```bash
gokr-packer -overwrite=/dev/sdX ./apps/runtime
```

Replace /dev/sdX with the target device (e.g., an SD card for a Raspberry Pi).

Access the runtime on the device's IP address.

### SSL with Caddy

Use Caddy as a reverse proxy to provide SSL for the runtime and UI.

Install Caddy:

```bash
sudo apt install -y caddy
```

Configure Caddy (Caddyfile):

````caddyfile

hyperdrive.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
    tls {
        email your-email@example.com
    }
}

runtime.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:5000
    tls {
        email your-email@example.com
    }
}
Start Caddy:

```bash
sudo systemctl start caddy
````

Your runtime and UI will now be accessible over HTTPS.

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev    # Start all applications in development mode
pnpm run build  # Build all applications
pnpm run test   # Run tests
pnpm run lint   # Run linting
pnpm run clean  # Clean build artifacts
```

## Architecture

### Runtime

The PLC runtime is written in Go and provides:

- IEC 61131-3 program execution
- Physical I/O handling
- WebSocket server for UI communication
- Modbus TCP server
- OPC UA server

### UI

The web UI is built with:

- React
- TanStack Start
- tRPC
- Shadcn UI
- WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- Typed API (defined in @hyperdrive/api)

### IDE

The IDE is based on Monaco editor and provides:

- A modern, browser based, extensible development environment
- Chevrontain parser for IEC 61131-3 programming with full LSP support
- Syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and validation
- AST-based program representation for online changes
- Integration with the runtime for compilation and debugging

## Communication

### Server-to-UI Communication

Protocol: WebSocket
Schema: Defined using AsyncAPI
Purpose: Real-time updates for variable values, program state, and diagnostics

### Shared Types

Tool: Quicktype
Purpose: Generate shared types for both TypeScript and Go
Location: packages/api

## API Documentation

OpenAPI
RESTful APIs for configuration and management are defined using OpenAPI.
Documentation is auto-generated and available at /docs.

### AsyncAPI

Real-time communication (WebSocket) is defined using AsyncAPI.
Code generation for clients and servers is supported.
